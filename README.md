\section{Problem Set-up}

\begin{itemize}
    \item``\texttt{covid\_Parameters\_months.m}"
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  This file contains all parameter values. It is called upon in ``Cost Effectiveness Main.m"; note that it is also copied in ``2. Problem Solving" so that the user can simply download this whole file to re-run the results.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item ``\texttt{ConstraintOnDrug.m}"
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is file is used to find the maximum level of infection of an uncontrolled outbreak that is used to determine the upper-bound constraint (i.e. 100\%) of the drug control. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item ``\texttt{InitialConditions.m}"
    
        \begin{itemize}
        \item This is the file used to find simulate out the outbreak to yield the initial conditions of our problem.
        \end{itemize}
    
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Problem Solving}

\begin{itemize}

    \item``\texttt{covid\_Parameters\_months.m}"
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Same as above.
    \end{itemize}
    
    
    \item``\texttt{covid19\_Main.m}"
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This is the main file. The reader only needs to open this file to rerun our analysis. However, please make sure that ``\texttt{covid\_Parameters\_months.m}", ``\texttt{covid19\_Drugs.m}", and ``\texttt{covid19\_Vaccines.m}" are copied in the same folder. 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item By choosing ``\texttt{omega=0}" and ``\texttt{ODE=1}", one will get the results from ``\texttt{workspacePN\_Gauss.mat}". Once yield, the workspace needs to be saved with the corresponding name.
                    \item By choosing ``\texttt{omega=0}" and ``\texttt{ODE=2}", one will get the results from ``\texttt{workspacePT\_Gauss.mat}". Once yield, the workspace needs to be saved with the corresponding name.
                    \item By choosing ``\texttt{omega=1/6}" and ``\texttt{ODE=1}", one will get the results from ``\texttt{workspaceST\_Gauss.mat}". Once yield, the workspace needs to be saved with the corresponding name.
                    \item By choosing  ``\texttt{omega=1/6}" and ``\texttt{ODE=2}", one will get the results from ``\texttt{workspaceSN\_Gauss.mat}". Once yield, the workspace needs to be saved with the corresponding name.
                \end{itemize}

    \item ``\texttt{covid19\_Drugs.m}"
            \begin{itemize}
            \item This file relates to the drug control of the problem. It details the state variables, the control variables, the ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the state variables, the constraints on state and controls variables across the different treatment scenarios (optimal and ad hoc), the objective of the central planning agency, how we generate our initial guess of the solution, and how we switch solvers if the chosen solver cannot find a solution.
            \end{itemize}
    
    
    \item ``\texttt{covid19\_Vaccines.m}"
            \begin{itemize}
            \item This file relates to the vaccine control of the problem. It details the state variables, the control variables, the ordinary differential equations describing the dynamics of the state variables, the constraints on state and controls variables across the different treatment scenarios (optimal and ad hoc), the objective of the central planning agency, how we generate our initial guess of the solution, and how we switch solvers if the chosen solver cannot find a solution.

\section{Problem Analysis}

\begin{itemize}

    \item ``\texttt{ManuscriptFigures.m}"

        \item This file uses ``\texttt{workspacePN\_Gauss.mat}", ``\texttt{workspacePS\_Gauss.mat}", ``\texttt{workspaceSN\_Gauss.mat}", and ``\texttt{workspaceSS\_Gauss.mat}" to produce the figures in the manuscript.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item ``\texttt{COVID\_Robustness\_Drugs.m}"
    
        \begin{itemize}
        \item This file uses ``\texttt{workspacePN\_Gauss.mat}", ``\texttt{workspacePS\_Gauss.mat}", ``\texttt{workspaceSN\_Gauss.mat}", and ``\texttt{workspaceSS\_Gauss.mat}" to produce the robustness checks with drugs.
        \end{itemize}
        
    \item ``\texttt{COVID\_Robustness\_Vaccines.m}"
    
        \begin{itemize}
        \item This file uses ``\texttt{workspacePN\_Gauss.mat}", ``\texttt{workspacePS\_Gauss.mat}", ``\texttt{workspaceSN\_Gauss.mat}", and ``\texttt{workspaceSS\_Gauss.mat}" to produce the robustness checks with vaccines.
